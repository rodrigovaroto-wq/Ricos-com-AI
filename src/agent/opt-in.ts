/**
 * Marketing opt-in (decision of 2026-09-28: option B of
 * docs/agente-ia/05-plano/07-opt-in-marketing.md). Meta sends a MARKETING template only to
 * someone who agreed to receive it from a named business; a click on the ad is not that.
 * So the code — never the model — asks once, inside the 24-hour window, and records a yes.
 *
 * The consent is a KEYWORD, not a "sim". Four review rounds (2026-09-28) found a "sim" that
 * answered something else every time the anchor moved: the touch's own question, the bubble
 * before, the agent's "Tá certinho assim?" before the silence. "Sim" answers anything; only a
 * word nothing else asks for answers this question alone, whatever came before it or after.
 *
 * - `optInQuestion`: a message of its own, after the ruler's first touch, when the operator
 *   turns the question on (`channel.askMarketingOptIn === true`; absent = never asked).
 * - `acceptsMarketingOptIn`: whether her reply gives the keyword, alone, within 24h of the
 *   question. Anything unclear is a no: a wrong yes sends marketing to someone who never
 *   agreed (and spam reports can cost the only number); a wrong no costs two touches.
 * - `revokesMarketingOptIn`: whether a message, at any time, takes the consent back. It lives
 *   here, beside the yes, because the question teaches the word she will revoke with ("não
 *   quero ofertas"), and `classifyOptOut` — which stops everything — does not read it.
 *
 * Zero imports, so it can be mirrored byte for byte into `supabase/functions/turn/` like the
 * guardrail chain. The turn runs `classifyOptOut` before this; an opt-out never gets here.
